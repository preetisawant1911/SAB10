📝 Project Reflection
1. What I Built
I created a fully functional Recipe Discovery App using React, TypeScript, Context API, custom hooks, and TheMealDB API.
The app allows users to browse categories, view recipes, search meals, and save favorites.

2. What I Learned
During this project, I learned:

How to structure a scalable React + TypeScript application

How to use Context API for global state management

How to build and reuse custom hooks like useFetch

How to work with dynamic routing using React Router

How to extract and display API data cleanly

How to design responsive UI using CSS Grid and Flexbox

How to debug TypeScript errors and improve type safety

3. Challenges I Faced
Some challenges I encountered:

Handling TypeScript errors in context and props

Extracting ingredients and measures dynamically

Managing loading and error states

Organizing folder structure professionally

Ensuring all pages were responsive and clean

Each challenge helped me understand React and TypeScript more deeply.

4. How I Solved Problems
Used TypeScript interfaces to ensure correct data shapes

Created reusable components like RecipeCard, Spinner, and ErrorMessage

Used useFetch to avoid repeating API logic

Used Context API to manage favorites globally

Broke UI into clean, maintainable parts

Tested each page step‑by‑step to avoid large bugs

5. What I Would Improve in the Future
If I had more time, I would add:

Pagination for search results

Dark mode

LocalStorage persistence for favorites

A “Random Recipe” feature

Better animations and transitions

6. Final Thoughts
This project helped me grow as a developer.
I improved my understanding of React, TypeScript, API integration, and clean UI design.
I feel more confident building real‑world applications now.
